    desc: "We have witnessed tremendous successes in world food production over the past five decades. This has made food more affordable for the majority of the world's population, despite a doubling in population. However, it has exerted undesirable pressure on terrestrial as well as aquatic ecosystems and they are now failing to provide adequate nutrition. This model of resource-intensive agriculture is not desirable in a world with finite resources provided by the Earthâ€™s land, oceans, and atmosphere. Therefore, we have recently built several Food computers in our lab, which is expected to contribute in the development of a new food production model that is environmentally friendly and takes advantage of the advancement in technology and the Omics-knowledge relating to living organism to make it economically desirable as well. Two major research areas of interest in the Collaborative Laboratory for Applied Bioinformatics (CLAB) include: (a) how the function of mitochondria, the major contributor of cell metabolism impact not only the quality of food produced in plant but also affect human health and various diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration and microbiome. (b) What are the technological choices and paths for improving productivity, economic and environmental performance of culinary herbs and medicinally important plants?",
